I'm a principal developer at Cycle Labs, where we develop the Cycle test automation platform.
I primarily work in Scala/Akka and Go. My focus recently has been on expanding the capabilities
of that platform as we migrate to kubernetes, expose the functionality of the engine through a 
GraphQL API, and refactor the application into microservices which communicate over gRPC.
