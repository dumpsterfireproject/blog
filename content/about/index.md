I'm a director of product and engineering at Cycle Labs, where we develop the Cycle test automation platform. 
I'm primarily working in Go and Scala/Akka and expanding into PostgreSQL and OpenAI, creating new offerings that utilize the PGVector extension to query some embeddings and also utlize some RAG (retrieval augmented generation).

My previous experiences include:
- Senior software engineer at caring.com, converting a ruby on rails monoligh to a series of microservices written in Go and deployed to AWS, communicating over gRPC.
- Principal developer at Cycle Labs.
- Sofware engineer at Tryon Solutions and RedPrairie (now Blue Yonder) creating custom Java, C, and C# applications for customer's Warehouse Management Systems.
- City of Raleigh systems programmer, working primarily as a PL/SQL, java, and Pro*C developer.
- I have also been a contributor to the Cucumber open source project.
