  Hi, Iâ€™m Brian!

Software developer from Raleigh, NC.  Primarily I code in Scala/Akka and Go.
I spend most of my time working on GraphQL APIs and gRPC based micro-services.

This blog is mostly for myself; a place to take notes and try to better organize my thoughts
so that I can better mentor members of my team. If you happen to have stumbled across this, 
I hope you find some of the content here useful.
